AxisStatusInChannelAdresses BackwardsOnPath The function for forward/backward motion on the path permits backward motion along the originally programmed path by means of a real-time signal when the NC program is active. Backward motion is terminated by resetting the real-time signal. Forward motion is then resumed. BlockSearch The operator can start machining at what is called the continuation position at any point in the program. After a program is interrupted (e.g. tool breakage), this is a quick method to reactivate machining at the point of interruption. The continuation position can be defined using a number of different block search types(file offset, block counter, block number, etc.). CNC Represents the TwinCAT CNC system. This class provides access to the CNC's platform, axes, and channels, CncAxis Represents a CNC axis and provides access to its status, external commanding, and dynamic position limitation. This class allows interaction with the axis to read its state, command movements, and set position limits. CncChannel The CncChannel class represents a CNC channel and provides various functionalities to manage and control the CNC operations. It includes properties and methods to interact with different aspects of the CNC, such as operation modes, the interpolator, control commands, contour visualization, feed override, path motion, single block mode, block search, distance to go, data streaming, technology processes, error management, zero offsets, and manual operation. The class also provides properties to read the covered block motion percentage, covered path distance, line count of the NC program, and path feed rates. CncPlatform Platform data is data which cannot be assigned to a specific axis or a channel but has an effect on the entire NC control. It allows reading various properties of the CNC platform such as the tick counter, cycle time, version, number of axes, number of channels, and their respective maximum allowable counts. Constants Constants used in the TwinCAT CNC system. ContourVisualization The controller can supply the axis positions for the graphic display of machine movements and visualise them by means of a user program or in the graphic user interface. ControlCommands The ControlCommands class provides methods to interact with and control various aspects of the CNC. It allows for the activation and deactivation of skip modes, reading and setting the current and commanded channel modes, and enabling or disabling optional stops during NC program execution. DataStreaming With the incremental specification of motion commands (streaming), the CAD/CAM system or the PLC stipulates the next path segment to be travelled (or even several segments). In this way, motion information not previously specified can still be modified until shortly before entering the command. DeleteDistanceToGo The \"Delete distance to go\" function interrupts the actual path motion and starts a short cut by straight line to the target position of next block. The distance to go of the current (interrupted) block is then deleted. DynamicPositionLimitation Additionally needs to be activated in the startup parameters by using the keyword FCT_DYN_POS_LIMIT of the parameter P-STUP-00070 ErrorCodes Lists all the known error codes and descriptions that can be returned by the CNC system. ErrorManagement The ErrorManagement class is responsible for handling error messages from the CNC. It subscribes to error notifications, reads error messages, and provides functions to acknowledge them. When an error is received, it triggers the ErrorRecieved event with detailed error information. ErrorRecievedEventArgs Event arguments for when an error is received. Contains the error information and a description of the error. Extensions Contains extension methods for various classes. ExternalAxisCommanding Specifying velocity or position command values by the PLC effective in addition to the interpolator. No monitoring takes place of transferred values for compliance with the dynamic axis limits. To activate this interface, set the parameter P-AXIS-00732 to 1. FeedOverride Provides properties to read and control the feed override of a channel. FeedOverrideAdresses Contains the adresses of the feed override variables. Can be used to add device notifications, sum read commands etc. HandWheelInc Control unit to manage the count of handwheel increments for a handwheel index, including flow control of user data. HcodeNeedsAcknowledgeEventArgs Event args supplied when a H code needs to be acknowledged. HrParameters Control unit to manage data for parameterising handwheel mode in manual mode, including flow control of user data Interpolator The Interpolator class provides an interface to interact with a CNC interpolator via an AdsClient. It allows reading and writing various properties related to the interpolator's state, such as axis count, moved path, velocity, tool life, and more. The class also provides addresses for device notifications and methods to retrieve interpolator addresses and properties. InterpolatorAdresses Adresses for the interpolator class. JogParameters Control unit to manage data for parameterising incremental jog mode in manual manual, including flow control of user data Key Control unit to manage data to enforce a button press in manual mode, including flow control of user data. ManualOperation Class that contains settings and functions for the manual operation of a CNC machine. Such as keys, rapid keys and hand wheels. McodeNeedsAcknowledgeEventArgs Event args supplied when a M code needs to be acknowledged. ObjectDescription Represents the description of a TASK COM object. OperationModeAdresses This class contains the adresses of objects used by the operation mode manager. OperationModeManager The OperationModeManager class provides an interface to manage and control the operation modes and states of the CNC via an AdsClient. It allows setting and retrieving the current operation mode and state, resetting the operation mode, and managing the interface existence. RapidKey During continuous jog mode it is possible to switch between the normal velocity and rapid traverse velocity. Here the rapid traverse is a button-specific feature and only becomes effective when the corresponding button is pushed and linked to an axis. SingleBlock When single-step mode is active, the machine operator has the option to execute an NC program step by step. The operator releases every NC line one by one. Comment lines or comment blocks and skipped blocks are skipped. TechnologyProcesses The TechnologyProcesses class manages the interaction with CNC technology units via an ADS client. It handles the acknowledgment of M and H codes, processes notifications from the CNC, and provides methods to read and acknowledge technology units. TipParameters Control unit to manage data for parameterising continuous jog mode in manual mode, including flow control of user data. ZeroOffsets The ZeroOffsets class is responsible for handling zero offsets (G54 etc) in the CNC system. Structs HLI_ADD_CMD_VALUE Specifying velocity or position command values by the SPS effective in addition to the interpolator.No monitoring takes place of transferred values for compliance with the dynamic axis limits.

EtherCatDevice Describes an EtherCAT device, using all standard objects as defined from the EtherCAT standard. This class can be derived and extended to create a specific EtherCAT device. EtherCatMaster The EtherCatMaster class provides methods to interact with an EtherCAT master device. It allows for reading the current state, device type, and name of the master, as well as retrieving information about connected slaves, such as their configuration, state, and topology. Additionally, it can read unexpected state changes and convert device status to a string representation. Extensions Contains extension methods for various classes. FileFinder This class can search for files and enumerate them on a remote TwinCAT target. FileSystem The FileSystem class provides methods for interacting with the file system on a target device using the TwinCAT ADS protocol. It allows opening, closing, reading, writing, seeking, deleting files, as well as creating and deleting directories. License Represents a license manager for a TwinCAT system. Realtime The Realtime class provides methods to interact with the TwinCAT systems real-time settings. It allows setting shared cores configuration, reading CPU settings, reading CPU latency, and getting the current CPU usage. It uses the AdsClient to communicate with the TwinCAT system. Scope Class to interact with a TwinCAT 2 scope. Note: not compatible with TwinCAT 3. SumReader Using the ADS Sum Command it is possible to read or write several variables in one command.
